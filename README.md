## Bruce Lee's Philosophy

The design and content of this site is deeply rooted in Bruce Lee's "Be Water" philosophy:

> "Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless â€” like water. Now you put water in a cup, it becomes the cup; You put water into a bottle it becomes the bottle; You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend." - Bruce Lee
